	/**
	 * @class GDPushChannel
	 * @classdesc This class encapsulates the GD Push Channel object.  The Push Channel framework is a
	 * BlackBerry Dynamics (GD) feature used to receive notifications from an application server.  Note that
	 * the GD Push Channel feature is not part of the native iOS notification feature set; however,
	 * Push Channels are dependent on the Push Connection, and Push Channels can only be established when
	 * the Push Connection is open and operating.<br/>
	 * <br/>
	 * Push Channels are established from the client end, then used by the server when needed. The sequence
	 * of events is as follows:<br/>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>The client sets an event handler for Push Channel notifications</li>
	 * <li>The client application requests a Push Channel token from the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure</li>
	 * <li>The client application sends the token to its server using, for example, a socket or HTTP request</li>
	 * <li>The client can now wait for a Push Channel notification</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * The BlackBerry Dynamics platform keeps data communications between client and server alive while the client is
	 * waiting for a Push Channel notification. This is achieved by sending "heartbeat" messages at an interval
	 * that is dynamically optimized for battery and network performance.<br/>
	 * <br/>
	 * NOTE: Create a new push channel by calling <a href="GDPushConnection.html#createPushChannel">GDPushConnection.createPushChannel</a>.
	 *
	 * @property {function} onChannelResponse This function is the callback handler that is called
	 * whenever a response is returned from the channel connection.  This function should check
	 * the value of the responseType returned and determine the required action to take.  If the
	 * responseType = "open", then the channelID returned in the response should be used to reference this
	 * channel in subsequent calls over this connection (see <a href="#close">GDPushChannel.close</a>).  NOTE: This
	 * function is required to be a non-null value.

	 * Channels exist within the Push Connection. Opening a Push Channel will not succeed if the Push
	 * Connection is not open and operating.
	 *
	 * @return {GDPushChannelResponse} A push channel response object in JSON format.  The result should be
	 * parsed and saved as a GDPushChannelResponse object in the callback handler.  If the channel was
	 * opened then the response object will be initialize with a channelID property that can be used to
	 * reference this channel connection.  Additionally, the response will also contain a token that uniquely
	 * identifies the device associated with this push channel.  Since this is an asynchronous call, the
