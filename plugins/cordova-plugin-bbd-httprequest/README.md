BBD Cordova HttpRequest plugin
==============================
> The HttpRequest plugin is used send HTTP requests over the internet. It also encapsulates the HTTP response returned from a HttpRequest's send function.

Location
========
`BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-httprequest`

Setup
=====
> __Note:__ `BBD Cordova HttpRequest plugin` is dependent on
> * `BBD Cordova Base plugin`

1. Install dependencies for BBD Cordova Base plugin
    ```
    $ cd <path/to/package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base
    $ npm install
    ```
2. We recommend to create your Cordova application in the same folder as plugins
    ```
    $ cd <path/to/package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins
    $ cordova create cordovaApp your.app.id App
    ```

Installation
============
To add this plugin to your application, run the following command in the project directory:
```
$ cd <path/to/package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordovaApp
$ cordova plugin add ../cordova-plugin-bbd-httprequest
```

API reference
=============
`window.plugins.GDHttpResponse`
```javascript
/**
* @class GDHttpResponse
* @classdesc This class encapsulates the HTTP response returned from a GDHttpRequest's send function.
* @param {string} json The input data (formatted as JSON text) used to construct the response object.
* @property {string} headers The HTTP response headers.
* @property {string} status The HTTP response status.
* @property {string} statusText The textual HTTP response status, as sent by the server, or details of error if the returned status is 0.
* @property {string} responseText The data returned from the HTTP request.  This data is retrieved from the JSON string that was passed into this function.  If the input to this function is not in valid JSON format, then this property will be the empty string.
* @property {string} responseData This is the raw (unparsed) data that was passed into this function.  This data is useful as a means to support manual processing/parsing if the input data could not be parsed as a JSON object.
* @property {string} responseState This value represents the current state of the opened HTTP process.  The response is not complete until the responseState reaches the "DONE" state. The following states are valid:
* - "HEADERS_RECEIVED" Response headers have been received.
* - "LOADING" Response headers and some data have been received. The loading state is typically indicative of an incremental request that is in progress.
* - "DONE" All data has been received, or a permanent error has been encountered.
* @return {GDHttpResponse}
*/
```

`window.plugins.GDHttpRequest`
```javascript
/**
* @class GDHttpRequest
* @classdesc Implements the secure HTTP communications APIs.
* @property {string} method Case-sensitive string containing the HTTP method, which will be sent to the server. Typical values are: "GET", "POST", "HEAD", "OPTIONS", "TRACE", "PUT", "CONNECT". Any other value is sent as a custom method.
* @property {string} url Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that will be requested. The URL must be fully qualified, including a scheme, domain, and path. For example: "http://www.example.com/index.html".
* @property {number} timeout Length of time out in seconds, or 0 (zero) for never. A negative timeout number will allow this request to use the default timeout value (30 seconds).
* @property {boolean} isAsync Set this value to true to make asynchronous calls.
* @property {string} user Authentication username. For Kerberos, this is in the user@realm format.
* @property {string} password Authentication password.
* @property {string} auth The authentication scheme.  Valid values are:
* - "NTLM" to use NTLM authentication (NTLM version 2 is not supported)</li>
* - "DIGEST" to use Digest Access authentication
* - "NEGOTIATE" to use negotiated Kerberos authentication
* - "BASIC" or a null pointer to use Basic Access authentication
* @property {boolean} isIncremental Determine if the response from an asynchronous HTTP request should be processed incrementally (as soon as data is received), or if the entire request should be returned within a single response.
* @property {boolean} disableHostVerification Disable host name verification, when making an HTTPS request. Host name verification is an SSL/TLS security option.
* @property {boolean} disableFollowLocation Disable automatic following of redirections. When automatic following is disabled, the application must handle redirection itself, including handling Location: headers, and HTTP statuses in the 30x range.
* @property {boolean} disablePeerVerification Disable certificate authenticity verification, when making an HTTPS request. Authenticity verification is an SSL/TLS security option.
* @property {boolean} disableCookieHandling Disable automatic cookie handling. When automatic handling is disabled, the application must store and process cookies itself.
* @property {string} cookieState Stores a value that determines whether or not cookies should be cleared prior to sending the request.  This value should not be set directly.  Instead, call the clearCookies method.
* @property {string} host The address of the proxy. Can be either an Internet Protocol address (IP address, for example "192.168.1.10"), or a fully qualified domain name (for example "www.example.com").
* @property {number} port Number of the port on the proxy to which connection will be made.
* @property {string} proxyUser The proxy authentication username.
* @property {string} proxyPassword The proxy authentication password.
* @property {string} proxyAuth The proxy authentication scheme.  Valid values are:
* - "NTLM" to use NTLM authentication (NTLM version 2 is not supported)
* - "DIGEST" to use Digest Access authentication
* - "BASIC" or a null pointer to use Basic Access authentication
* @property {string} fileName The path (optional) and filename of the file to upload if this is a file upload request. If path is omitted, the file is read from the current working directory. NOTE: There is no need to set this property directly since it will be set during the sendFile function call (see <a href="#sendFile">sendFile</a>).
* @property {object} sendOptions This object contains any optional parameters that are sent with the HTTP request.  This value should not be set directly.  Instead, call the desired optional methods to set the request parameters (e.g. addPostParameter, addRequestHeader, addHttpBody).

`window.plugins.GDHttpRequest.createRequest`
```javascript
/**
* @function GDHttpRequest#createRequest
* @description Call this function to create the HTTP request, and set the main parameters. NOTE: This function only initializes the HTTP parameters; it does not initiate data transfer (see send).
* @param {string} method Case-sensitive string containing the HTTP method, which will be sent to the server. Typical values are: "GET", "POST", "HEAD", "OPTIONS", "TRACE", "PUT", "CONNECT". Any other value is sent as a custom method.
* @param {string} url Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that will be requested. The URL must be fully qualified, including a scheme, domain, and path. For example: "http://www.example.com/index.html".

`window.plugins.GDHttpRequest.clearCookies`
```javascript
/**
* @function GDHttpRequest#clearCookies
* @description Clear cookies that were automatically stored. Cookies can be cleared from memory only, or from the persistent cookie store too. If cleared from memory only, cookies will still be reloaded from the persistent cookie store when the application is next launched.  This function is most useful when automatic cookie handling is enabled (i.e. GDHttpRequest.disableCookieHandling = false).
* @param {boolean} includePersistentStore When this value is set to true, then all cookies are cleared from memory and the persistent cookie storage file.  When this value is false, then all cookies are cleared from memory only.
*/
```

`window.plugins.GDHttpRequest.enableHttpProxy`
```javascript
/**
* @function GDHttpRequest#enableHttpProxy
* @description Call this function to configure an HTTP proxy address and credentials, and enable connection through the proxy.  The proxy server can be located behind the enterprise firewall. In this case its address must be registered in the enterprise's Good Control (GC) console. Registration would usually be as a enterprise management console additional server. <a href="https://begood.good.com/community/gdn">See the Good Control overview for application developers</a>.  Certificate authenticity verification while using a proxy is not currently supported. When making HTTPS requests through a proxy, SSL/TLS certificate verification must be disabled, see the disablePeerVerification function. This function should be called before <a href="#send">GDHttpRequest.send</a> or  <a href="#sendFile">GDHttpRequest.sendFile</a> has been called.
* @param {string} host The address of the proxy. Can be either an Internet Protocol address (IP address, for example "192.168.1.10"), or a fully qualified domain name (for example "www.example.com").
